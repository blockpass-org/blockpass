# Multiple dashboards

Merchants can use the same docker install to host multiple dashboards and QR codes. 

- Create 2 or more services in the Blockpass Developer Portal
- Generate a STANDALONE_CONFIG parameter based on all the services you have created
- Run the installation script and provide the STANDALONE_CONFIG generated (see [instructions](./dashboard-home.md))
- Once installation is finished, create reviewers accounts and assign them to one or more dashboards.
